## üìù Implementation Highlights

- **Authentication & Security:**  
  All sensitive data is protected using JWT tokens and bcrypt-hashed passwords. CAS login ensures only IIIT users can register. All backend APIs are protected and require valid tokens.

- **Order & Delivery Flow:**  
  Orders are placed via the cart, with OTP-based completion for secure handover. OTPs are hashed in the localstorage for security.

- **Search & Filter:**  
  Powerful search and multi-category filter for products, with real-time updates.

- **Chatbot Support:**  
  AI-powered chatbot for instant support, with session-based memory for context-aware responses.

- **Robust Routing:**  
  All routes are protected; unauthorized access redirects to login. Navigation bar is always visible post-login for seamless navigation.

- **Clean, modular codebase with RESTful APIs and React best practices**
